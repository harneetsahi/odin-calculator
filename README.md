Previously app.js was linked to index.html file but it lacked some functionality where the operation was performed only once and you would need to clear the display to carry out another operation. Script.js is updated with better functionality to carry out back to back operations.

With script.js, the result of previous function is assigned to the result variable so we can use it for the next step of the process.
